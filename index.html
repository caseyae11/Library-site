                Welcome! Thank you for your interest in Open Education Resources. For this module, you will pick one of two stories to follow; the first being about a professor interested in textbook alternatives, and the second about a student looking for images they can lawfully use in an online project. 
                At the end of each story, you will be given the option to go back to the beginning and explore the other journey, or exit for a bonus pass. With the pass, you can complete a short quiz for the chance to win one of two $50 gift cards!
                <br> <br>
                Select a story. Faculty to the left or Student to the right.
